        <p> <h2><center>  Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Space</center></h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is so much about space, our solar system, and the galaxy that we still don't know!  Space is vast. With billions of galaxies and stars, and planets in our own solar system yet to be fully explored or understood, scientists' knowledge of space is always evolving.  There are, however, some really cool things we know about space right now!  We've compiled a list of what we think are ten stellar facts that we hope you'll think are out of this world!  </li>
            <li>There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. </li>
            <li>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury.  You would think that Mercury would then be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big fluctuations. </li>
            <li>While the entire suit costs a cool $12m, 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module. However, the space suits that NASA uses were built in 1974.  If these were priced by today's pricing, they would cost an estimated 150 million dollars!</li>
            <li>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass attributed to helium.  If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?</li>
            <li>The Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the Earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of Earths? </li>
            <li>There are about three trillion trees on Planet Earth, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy.</li>
            <li>Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, sunsets on Mars, according to NASA,  would appear bluish to human observers watching from the red planet. Fine dust makes the blue near the Sun's part of the sky much more visibilke, while normal daylight makes the Red Planet's familiar rusty dust color the most perceptible to the human eye.</li>
            <li>The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way, which is why scientists can only estimate how many stars are in space.  However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.   While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.  That is an awfully big sand castle!</li>
            <li>Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 Earth days to complete its day. The orbit of Venus around the Sun is 225 Earth days, making a year on Venus 18 days less than a day on Venus.</li>
            <li>There’s a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, is most likely covered in graphite and diamond.  Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for the $12 million dollar space suit needed to get there!</li>

        <p><h2><center>Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Sun</center></h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system. It has a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. It is three quarters hydrogen and most of its remaining mass is helium.</li>
            <li>Over one million Earth’s could fit inside the Sun. If you were to fill a hollow Sun with spherical Earths, somewhere around 960,000 would fit inside. However, if you squashed those Earths to ensure there was no wasted space then you could fit 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. The surface area of the Sun is 11,990 times that of Earth.</li>
            <li>One day the Sun will consume the Earth. The Sun will continue to burn for about 130 million years after it burns through all of its hydrogen, instead burning helium. During this time it will expand to such a size that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and Earth. When it reaches this point, it will have become a red giant star.</li>
            <li>The energy created by the Sun’s core is nuclear fusion. This huge amount of energy is produced when four hydrogen nuclei are combined into one helium nucleus.</li>
            <li>The Sun is almost a perfect sphere. Considering the sheer size of the Sun, there is only a 10 km difference in its polar and equatorial diameters – this makes it the closest thing to a perfect sphere observed in nature.</li>
            <li>The Sun is travelling at 220 km per second. It is around 24,000-26,000 light-years from the galactic centre and it takes the Sun approximately 225-250 million years to complete one orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.</li>
            <li>The Sun will eventually be about the size of Earth. Once the Sun has completed its red giant phase, it will collapse. It’s huge mass will be retained, but it will have a volume similar to that of Earth. When that happens, it will be known as a white dwarf.</li>
            <li>It takes eight minutes for light reach Earth from the Sun. The average distance from the Sun to the Earth is about 150 million km. Light travels at 300,000 km per second so dividing one by the other gives you 500 seconds – eight minutes and twenty seconds. This energy can reach Earth in mere minutes, but it takes millions of years to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.</li>
            <li>The Sun is halfway through its life. At 4.5 billion years old, the Sun has burned off around half of its hydrogen stores and has enough left to continue burning hydrogen for another 5 billion years. Currently the Sun is a yellow dwarf star.</li>
            <li>The distance between Earth and Sun changes. This is because the Earth travels on a elliptical orbit path around the Sun. The distance between the two ranges from 147 to 152 million km. This distance between them is one Astronomical Unit (AU).</li>
            <li>The Sun rotates in the opposite direction to Earth with the Sun rotating from west to east instead of east to west like Earth.</li>
            <li>The Sun rotates more quickly at its equator than it does close to its poles. This is known as differential rotation.</li>
            <li>The Sun has a powerful magnetic field. When magnetic energy is released by the Sun during magnetic storms, solar flares occur which we see on Earth as sunspots. Sunspots are dark areas on the Sun’s surface caused by magnetic variations. The reason they appear dark is due to their temperature being much lower than surrounding areas.</li>
            <li>Temperatures inside the Sun can reach 15 million degrees Celsius. Energy is generated through nuclear fusion in the Sun’s core – this is when hydrogen converts to helium – and because objects generally expand, the Sun would explode like an enormous bomb if it wasn’t for it’s tremendous gravitational pull.</li>
            <li>The Sun generates solar winds. These are ejections of plasma (extremely hot charged particles) that originate in the layer of the Sun know as the corona and they can travel through the solar system at up to 450 km per second.</li>
            <li>The atmosphere of the Sun is composed of three layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona.</li>
            <li>The Sun is classified as a yellow dwarf star. It is a main sequence star with surface temperatures between 5,000 and 5,700 degrees celsius (9,000 and 10,300 degrees fahrenheit).</li>
            <li>The Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis are caused by the interaction of solar winds with Earth’s atmosphere.</li>

        <p><h2><center>Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Venus</center></h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A day on Venus is longer than a year
                It takes Venus longer to rotate once on its axis than to complete one orbit of the Sun. That’s 243 Earth days to rotate once - the longest rotation of any planet in the Solar System - and only 224.7 Earth days to complete one orbit of the Sun.</li>
            <li>Venus is hotter than Mercury despite being further away from the Sun
                Its mean temperature is 462°C. This is because of the high concentration of carbon dioxide in Venus’ atmosphere which works to produce an intense greenhouse effect, trapping heat in the atmosphere like a blanket and causing the temperature of the planet to be much higher than its proximity to the Sun would suggest.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other planets in our solar system, Venus spins clockwise on its axis.
                All other planets spin anti-clockwise on their axis and orbit the Sun in an anti-clockwise direction. Venus also orbits the Sun anti-clockwise, but its unusual axis rotation is due to being upside down - it was knocked off its upright position earlier in its history! Astronomers believe that at some point, a colliding celestial body tilted Venus so far off its original position that it is now upside down. The only other planet to spin in a weird direction is Uranus which spins on its side, probably the result of another collision early on in its life.</li>
            <li>Venus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon
                The clouds of sulfuric acid in Venus’ atmosphere make it reflective and shiny and obscure our view of its surface. It's brightness makes it visible during the day if it’s clear and you know where to look</li>
            <li>Venus has 90 times the atmospheric pressure of Earth
                That’s about the same as the pressure at a depth of 1 km in Earth's oceans.</li>
            <li>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty
It is thought that Venus was named after the beautiful Roman goddess (counterpart to the Greek Aphrodite) due to its bright, shining appearance in the sky. Of the five planets known to ancient astronomers, it would have been the brightest.</li>
            <li>Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC
                Because Venus is easy to spot with the naked eye, it is impossible to say who discovered the planet. But over the centuries, we have been able to measure Venus’ motions, such as the rare transit of Venus when the planet appears from Earth to cross in front of the Sun.</li>
            <li>We tend to say ‘Venusian’ not ‘Venerian’
                Following the rules of Latin, we should say ‘venerean’ as the adjective to describe things related to Venus. However, this is deemed to be too close to the word ‘venereal’. The more commonly used word is ‘Venusian’ despite its clunky etymology.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Earth has never been perfectly round. The planet bulges around the equator by an extra 0.3 percent as a result of the fact that it rotates about its axis.  </li>
            <li>Earth's diameter from North to South Pole is 12,714 kilometers (7,900 miles), while through the equator it is 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles).  </li>
            <li>The difference — 42.78 kilometers (26.58 miles) — is about 1/300th the diameter of Earth. </li>
            <li>This variation is too tiny to be seen in pictures of Earth from space, so the planet appears round to the human eye</li>
            <li>Recent research from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggests that melting glaciers are causing Earth's waistline to spread.</li>
            <li>There are two other bodies orbiting near Earth that are sometimes referred to as moons, though they are not strictly worthy of the title. </li>
            <li>Discovered in 1986, 3753 Cruithne is an asteroid that actually orbits the sun. Since it takes the same amount of time to orbit the sun as Earth, it looks as if Cruithne is following our planet..</li>
            <li>Its orbit, when seen from the perspective of Earth, appears bean-shaped. Asteroid 2002 AA29 also orbits the sun once a year, following a more bizarre horseshoe-shaped path that brings it close to Earth (within about 5.9 million kilometers or 3.7 million miles) every 95 years.</li>
            <li>Because of its proximity to us, scientists have suggested collecting samples from AA29 and bringing them back to Earth.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2017 photographers share their top facts about the Moon. Visit Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year</li>
            <li>It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.</li>
            <li>Among those whose densities are known anyway. The first densest is Jupiter's satellite Io.</li>
            <li>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth. Its near side is marked by large dark plains (volcanic ‘maria’) that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters.</li>
            <li>Although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.​</li>
            <li>From Earth, both the Sun and the Moon look about same size. This is because, the Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, but also 400 times closer to Earth.</li>
            <li>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year.</li>
            <li>The most widely-accepted explanation is that the Moon was created when a rock the size of Mars slammed into Earth, shortly after the solar system began forming about 4.5 billion years ago.</li>
            <li>Everyone knows that the Moon is partly responsible for causing the tides of our oceans and seas on Earth, with the Sun also having an effect. However, as the Moon orbits the Earth it also causes a tide of rock to rise and fall in the same way as it does with the water. The effect is not as dramatic as with the oceans but nevertheless, it is a measurable effect, with the solid surface of the Earth moving by several centimetres with each tide</li>
            <li>They're not called earthquakes but moonquakes. They are caused by the gravitational influence of the Earth. Unlike quakes on Earth that last only a few minutes at most, moonquakes can last up to half an hour. They are much weaker than earthquakes though.</li>
            <li>This is in the form of ice trapped within dust and minerals on and under the surface. It has been detected on areas of the lunar surface that are in permanent shadow and are therefore very cold, enabling the ice to survive. The water on the Moon was likely delivered to the surface by comets.</li>

        <p><h2><center>Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Mars</center></h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mars is also known as the Red Planet. This is because Mars is covered in soil, rock, and dust made from iron oxide which gives the surface a red rusty colour.</li>
            <li>Mars is named after the Roman god of war.</li>
            <li>Mars has 2 moons called Deimos and Phobos. They are named after the two horses that pull the Roman god of war, Mars’, chariot. They may be asteroids captured by Mars’ gravity.</li>
            <li>Mars is the 4th planet from the sun. It is 227,936,637 km (141 million miles) away from the sun. It would take 300 days (around 8 months) to get there from Earth.</li>
            <li>Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of 4217 miles. This makes it the second smallest planet in our solar system.</li>
            <li>A day on Mars lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes.</li>
            <li>One year on Mars is 687 days long. That’s 1.9 Earth years. This is because Mars is further away from the sun so it takes longer to orbit it.</li>
            <li>The tilt on the axis of Mars is 25 degrees which means that the planet experiences seasons like we do on Earth as different parts of the planet are closer to the sun at different times of its orbit.</li>
            <li>Mars has a thin atmosphere made from 95.9% carbon dioxide and 2.7% nitrogen. The atmosphere is so thin that it’s not thick enough to trap the sun’s heat so it is very cold - ranging from -100℃ in winter to 20℃  in summer.</li>
            <li>Mars has very weak gravity. Gravity on Mars is 37% less than on Earth. This means that on Mars you could jump 3x higher than on Earth.</li>
            <li>Mars is a terrestrial planet because it has a hard and rocky surface. Its northern side is full of flat plains and the southern side has ridges and craters.</li>
            <li>Mars’ surface has many channels, plains, and canyons which could have been caused by water erosion (water wearing away the surface). This could be evidence that open water in liquid form once existed on the surface billions of years ago.</li>
            <li>Mars experiences violent dust storms powered by the sun which can last for months. The dust storms can completely cover the planet and continually change Mars’ surface.</li>
            <li>Mars is home to Olympus Mons, a dormant volcano and the largest volcano and highest mountain in our solar system. It is 16 miles high and 600 km across the base, making it 3x the height of Mount Everest.</li>
            <li>The biggest crater on Mars is Borealis Basin. It is 5300 miles from end to end and covers 40% of planet’s surface.</li>
            <li>Mars has the largest canyon in our solar system, Valles Marineris. It is 4 miles deep and stretches thousands of miles long.</li>
            <li>Mars has north and south poles like earth. The polar ice caps are covered in a layer of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice).</li>
            <li>As it’s so close to Earth, Mars is the planet that humans will most likely step foot on and explore first.</li>
            <li>We sent out Mars Rovers (which are like robots) on missions to explore Mars and collect samples and record scientific data for scientists on Earth to study. Some of these Rovers include Viking 1, Viking 2, Mars 2, Mars 3, Spirit, Phoenix, Pathfinder, Curiosity, and Opportunity.</li>
            <li>There is no evidence of life on Mars. However, it is the planet with the best conditions to support life and scientists believe there is potential for life under the surface of mars because they recently found water ice just under the surface.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Jupiter is the fourth brightest object in the solar system.
                Only the Sun, Moon and Venus are brighter. It is one of five planets visible to the naked eye from Earth.</li>
            <li>The ancient Babylonians were the first to record their sightings of Jupiter.
                This was around the 7th or 8th century BC. Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods. To the Greeks, it represented Zeus, the god of thunder. The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk and patron of the city of Babylon. Germanic tribes saw this planet as Donar, or Thor.</li>
            <li>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets.
                It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly, giving it an oblate shape.</li>

            <li>Jupiter orbits the Sun once every 11.8 Earth years.
                From our point of view on Earth, it appears to move slowly in the sky, taking months to move from one constellation to another.</li>
            <li>Jupiter has unique cloud features.
                The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into cloud belts and zones. They are made primarily of ammonia crystals, sulfur, and mixtures of the two compounds.</li>
            <li>The Great Red Spot is a huge storm on Jupiter.
                It has raged for at least 350 years. It is so large that three Earths could fit inside it.</li>
            <li>Jupiter’s interior is made of rock, metal, and hydrogen compounds.
                Below Jupiter’s massive atmosphere (which is made primarily of hydrogen), there are layers of compressed hydrogen gas, liquid metallic hydrogen, and a core of ice, rock, and metals.</li>
            <li>upiter’s moon Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.
                Jupiter’s moons are sometimes called the Jovian satellites, the largest of these are Ganymeade, Callisto Io and Europa. Ganymeade measures 5,268 km across, making it larger than the planet Mercury.</li>
            <li>Jupiter has a thin ring system.
                Its rings are composed mainly of dust particles ejected from some of Jupiter’s smaller worlds during impacts from incoming comets and asteroids. The ring system begins some 92,000 kilometres above Jupiter’s cloud tops and stretches out to more than 225,000 km from the planet. They are between 2,000 to 12,500 kilometres thick.</li>
            <li>Eight spacecraft have visited Jupiter.
                Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Cassini, Ulysses, and New Horizons missions. The Juno mission is its way to Jupiter and will arrive in July 2016. Other future missions may focus on the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, and their subsurface oceans.</li>

       <ul>
            <li>Saturn is huge. It is the second largest planet in our Solar System. Jupiter is the only planet that is bigger.</li>
            <li>You cannot stand on Saturn. It is not like Earth. Saturn is made mostly of gases. It has a lot of helium. This is the same kind of gas that you put in balloons.</li>
            <li>Its beautiful rings are not solid. They are made up of bits of ice, dust and rock.</li>
            <li>Some of these bits are as small as grains of sand. Some are much larger than tall buildings. Some are up to a kilometer (more than half-a-mile) across.</li>
            <li>The rings are huge but thin. The main rings could almost go from Earth to the moon. Yet, they are less than a kilometer thick.</li>
            <li>Other planets have rings. Saturn's rings are the only ones that can be seen from Earth. All you need is a small telescope.</li>
            <li>Saturn could float in water because it is mostly made of gas. (Earth is made of rocks and stuff.)</li>
            <li>It is very windy on Saturn. Winds around the equator can be 1,800 kilometers per hour. That's 1,118 miles per hour! On Earth, the fastest winds "only" get to about 400 kilometers per hour. That's only about 250 miles per hour.</li>
            <li>Saturn goes around the Sun very slowly. A year on Saturn is more than 29 Earth years.</li>
            <li>Saturn spins on its axis very fast. A day on Saturn is 10 hours and 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>he Ringed Planet is so far away from the Sun that it receives much less sunlight than we do here on Earth. Yes, the Sun looks smaller from there.</li>
            <li>The day Saturday was named after Saturn.</li>

        <p><h2><center>Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Uranus</center></h2></p>
       <ul>
           <li>Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Uranus would be the size of a basketball.</li>
           <li>Uranus orbits our Sun, a star, and is the seventh planet from the Sun at a distance of about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers).</li>
           <li>Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).</li>
           <li>Uranus is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>
           <li>Uranus has an atmosphere made mostly of molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, with a small amount of methane.</li>
           <li>Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</li>
           <li>Uranus has 13 known rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and the outer rings are brightly colored.</li>
           <li>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to fly by Uranus. No spacecraft has orbited this distant planet to study it at length and up close.</li>
           <li>Uranus cannot support life as we know it.</li>
           <li>Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west. But Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its side.</li>

        <p><h2><center>Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Neptune</center></h2></p>
       <ul>
           <li>It takes Neptune 164.8 Earth years to orbit the Sun. On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full orbit since its discovery in 1846.</li>
           <li>Neptune was discovered by Jean Joseph Le Verrier. The planet was not known to ancient civilizations because it is not visible to the naked eye. The planet was initially called Le Verrier after its discoverer. This name, however, quickly was abandoned and the name Neptune was chosen instead.</li>
           <li>Neptune is the Roman God of the Sea. In Greek, Neptune is called Poseidon.</li>
           <li>Neptune has the second largest gravity of any planet in the solar system – second only to Jupiter.</li>
           <li>The orbit path of Neptune is approximately 30 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. This means it is around 30 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.</li>
           <li>The largest Neptunian moon, Triton, was discovered just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered.
            Neptune has a storm similar the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. It is commonly known as the Great Dark Spot and is roughly the size of Earth.</li>
           <li>Neptune also has a second storm called the Small Dark Spot. This storm is around the same size as Earth’s moon.</li>
           <li>Neptune spins very quickly on its axis. The planets equatorial clouds take 18 hours to complete one rotation. The reason this happens is that Neptune does not have a solid body.</li>
           <li>Only one spacecraft, the Voyager 2, has flown past Neptune. It happened in 1989 and captured the first close-up images of the Neptunian system. It took 246 minutes – four hours and six minutes – for signals from Voyager 2 to reach back to Earth.</li>
           <li>The climate on Neptune is extremely active. In its upper atmosphere, large storms sweep across it and high-speed solar winds track around the planet at up to 1,340 km per second. The largest storm was the Great Dark Spot in 1989 which lasted for around five years.</li>
           <li>Like the other outer planets, Neptune possesses a ring system, though its rings are very faint. They are most likely made up of ice particles and grains of dust with a carbon-based substance coating them.</li>
           <li>Neptune has 14 known moons. The largest of these moons is Titan – a frozen world which spits out particles of nitrogen ice and dust from below its surface. It is believed that Titan was caught by the immense gravitational pull of Neptune and is regarded as one of the coldest worlds in our solar system.</li>
           <li>Neptune has an average surface temperature of -214°C – approximately -353°F.</li>

      <ul>
          <li>Pluto is named after the Roman god of the underworld.
            This was proposed by Venetia Burney an eleven year old schoolgirl from Oxford, England.</li>
            <li>Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.
                This is when the IAU formalised the definition of a planet as “A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.”</li>
            <li>Pluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930 by the Lowell Observatory.
                    For the 76 years between Pluto being discovered and the time it was reclassified as a dwarf planet it completed under a third of its orbit around the Sun.</li>
            <li>Pluto has five known moons.
                The moons are Charon (discovered in 1978,), Hydra and Nix (both discovered in 2005), Kerberos originally P4 (discovered 2011) and Styx originally P5 (discovered 2012) official designations S/2011 (134340) 1 and  S/2012 (134340) 1.</li>
            <li>Pluto is the largest dwarf planet.
                At one point it was thought this could be Eris. Currently the most accurate measurements give Eris an average diameter of 2,326km with a margin of error of 12km, while Pluto’s diameter is 2,372km with a 2km margin of error.</li>
            <li>Pluto is one third water.
                This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much water as in all the Earth’s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock. Pluto’s surface is covered with ices, and has several mountain ranges, light and dark regions, and a scattering of craters.</li>
            <li>Pluto is smaller than a number of moons.
                These are Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, Europa, Triton, and the Earth’s moon. Pluto has 66% of the diameter of the Earth’s moon and 18% of its mass. While it is now confirmed that Pluto is the largest dwarf planet for around 10 years it was thought that this was Eris.</li>
            <li>Pluto has a eccentric and inclined orbit.
                This takes it between 4.4 and 7.3 billion km from the Sun meaning Pluto is periodically closer to the Sun than Neptune.</li>
            <li>Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft.
                The New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006, flew by Pluto on the 14th of July 2015 and took a series of images and other measurements. New Horizons is now on its way to the Kuiper Belt to explore even more distant objects.</li>
